## Frogiington's Portfolio

A React + Vite based web application. This app needs work still, but will be populated with my, (Hello, I'm frogiington), work. This aaplication is deployed on netlify, and is my first foray into the world of React. 

### Future Implementations
In the future, I want to streamline the portfolio, adding flippable cards that will render the applications within the website, and does not have to take you somewhere else.
